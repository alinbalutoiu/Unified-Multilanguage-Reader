# Dependencies
Just like almost any other piece of code, it does not exist in isolation. Our project stands on the shoulders of giants, of we will discuss the biggest ones below:
## Python
### Flask
A framework was needed to allow us to run a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) server in Python. We decided on using the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for its comprehensability, simplicity and its active community supporting it. Furthermore, it allows us to share and reuse code more easily between other services of Zeeguu which also implement most of their functionality using Flask.

Flask (originally created as [an april-fools joke](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/4/3/april-1st-post-mortem/)) is, as of this moment in writing, the most popular Python web development framework on GitHub.
