# Workflow
The Zeeguu UMR team works in an Agile manner, loosly implementing [Scrum](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/UtqtPyT7ysKwghf7pxBhNnyB) to work in iterative sprints. Every sprint has its own Scrum board, which is represented by [Github's Project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) feature, and has a length of one week (starting on Tuesday).

## Automation
In our opinion, the most effective way of keeping things up-to-date is by having them done automatically.

### Continouous Integration
Every contribution to the source is automatically tested using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). This is what generates the build status badge you might see in our README or manual index. Succesfull builds of the **development_core** branch are deployed to the Heroku app, such that there is always a live location of the in-development version of UMR.

### Automatic Documentation
This documentation has been generated by [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org), a neat javascript documentation tool. Amoung other things, ESDoc generates badges describing the documentation coverage: how much of the code we have documented thus far. Our `autodoc.sh` script included in the repository makes use of ESDoc to automatically publish this documentation to the **gh-pages** branch if executed on **master**.

## Contributing
It is important to note that this project is indeed _[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)_, meaning that you **do not need our permission** to start tinkering and improving the sources! Simply:

1. Make an issue (or pick an existing one) for the feature/fix you which to implement.
2. Fork our repository.
3. Make a pull request to **development_core** once you are done implementing.
4. We will inspect your sources, possiblly apply feedback, and merge if it's OK.
