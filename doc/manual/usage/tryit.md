# Try it!
Feel like testing our service yourself, or just want to learn a new language? Zeeguu UMR is not just some dusty code in a repository: we are in production!

## Stable
The stable release, our **master** branch, can be found on [Zeeguu](https://www.zeeguu.unibe.ch) itself. This is where you can also practice with exercises based on your reading experience, and track your progress.

## Development
The **development** branch of UMR is automatically deployed on [Heroku](https://zeeguu-umr.herokuapp.com/debug_login) for every test-passing commit we make to it, so this is where you will always find the most-recent (but potentially less stable) version. Our Heroku account is a free one, with a significantly limited amount of memory and speed, so do not expect fast service there.
