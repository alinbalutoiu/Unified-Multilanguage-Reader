# Overview
When you learn a new language, you are provided with reading material that most often is boring and unattractive. As a result, learning a language can be a comprehensive and tedious process. Making it more seamless and intuitive will help people get more engaged, and thus, progress a lot more. People would like to read content that they find interesting, whilst also reaping the benefits of learning a new language.

## Goals and Scope
The purpose of this project is to provide our target users with a platform, where they can enjoy reading articles in different languages all the while having the translation possibilities at their fingertips. 
    
Therefore, the scope of this project is defined by the following requirements:

- Feed subscription system that uses the Zeeguu platform for retrieval of useful/interesting feeds, together with the articles they refer to.
- Article processing from a given url into a readable, non-intrusive format.
- On tap word translation that uses the Zeeguu platform to fetch an appropriate translation for a given word, derived from the context that that word is identified in and supplied to Zeeguu in the translation request.

## Constraints
The system should be modular and properly separated into components, both at the Back-end and at the Front-end, such that it can benefit from easy maintainability and extendability.

## Target Users
The users for this software are represented by individuals wishing to improve their reading skills, in a language they understand on a primary level or higher.

## Risks 
Some of the risks that this project might face are: 

- Stimulating the language learner by providing an entertaining environment that motivates him to come back and use the app.
- Being noticeably useful and helpful in the process of learning a new language.
- Being simple and intuitive enough that it does not distract the language learner, yet provide the necessary aid in learning the language.
