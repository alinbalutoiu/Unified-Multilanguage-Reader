      <div class="manual-card">
        <div data-ice="card"><h1>Overview</h1><p>When you learn a new language, you are provided with reading material that most often is boring and unattractive. As a result, learning a language can be a comprehensive and tedious process. Making it more seamless and intuitive will help people get more engaged, and thus, progress a lot more. People would like to read content that they find interesting, whilst also reaping the benefits of learning a new language.</p><h2>Goals and Scope</h2><p>The purpose of this project is to provide our target users with a platform, where they can enjoy reading articles in different languages all the while having the translation possibilities at their fingertips. </p><p>Therefore, the scope of this project is defined by the following requirements:</p><ul>
<li>Feed subscription system that uses the Zeeguu platform for retrieval of useful/interesting feeds, together with the articles they refer to.</li>
<li>Article processing from a given url into a readable, non-intrusive format.</li>
<li>On tap word translation that uses the Zeeguu platform to fetch an appropriate translation for a given word, derived from the context that that word is identified in and supplied to Zeeguu in the translation request.</li>
</ul><h2>Constraints</h2><p>The system should be modular and properly separated into components, both at the Back-end and at the Front-end, such that it can benefit from easy maintainability and extendability.</p><h2>Target Users</h2><p>The users for this software are represented by individuals wishing to improve their reading skills, in a language they understand on a primary level or higher.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>Some of the risks that this project might face are: </p><ul>
<li>Stimulating the language learner by providing an entertaining environment that motivates him to come back and use the app.</li>
<li>Being noticeably useful and helpful in the process of learning a new language.</li>
<li>Being simple and intuitive enough that it does not distract the language learner, yet provide the necessary aid in learning the language. </li>

      <h1 data-ice="label" class="manual-color manual-color-design" data-section-count="&#x25A0;&#x25A0;"><span data-ice="label-inner">Architectural Design</span></h1>
      <div class="manual-card">
        <div data-ice="card"><h1>Architectural Design</h1><h2>Goals</h2><p>The development of the Universal Multilingual Reader started off with the following design goals in mind:</p><ul>
<li>Aim for a clear separation of concerns in order to improve modularity of the system.</li>
<li>Focus on increasing intuitiveness between component coupling to facilitate extendability.</li>
<li>The implementation should strive for efficiency and avoid redundancy.</li>
</ul><h2>Front-end</h2><p>The font-end is the system our users will primarily interact with and will completely run on their local machines. This is to decrease the workload on our server, which in turn should lead to increased responsiveness on the users side. </p><p>We decided to split the system into three separate packages: subscription, translation, and zeeguuRequests. The latter being a package that abstracts away all networked communication with the Zeeguu Service and provides a simple universal interface instead. This division is meant to closely resemble the primary features. Additionally, there is a single shared file defining all constants used in the application, such that updates to (for example) endpoint locations can easily be applied trough a single constant update.</p><p>To adhere to our model-view-controller principles, most visual elements of the system have been constructed in simple HTML and CSS definitions, whilst we define a single control script for every package that binds certain methods to certain events.</p><h2>Subscription</h2><p>The content of the main page is divided into three essential parts: a list of articles, a list of currently subscribed feeds that allows you to remove feeds from your subscription list, a menu that lists available feeds for a given language that allows you to add feeds (subscribe to feeds). We tried to define classes based on this natural structure, where change in one class is propagated to change in all dependant classes (no active polling):</p><ul>
<li><strong>SubscriptionManager:</strong> This class is called by OnClick event listeners on the webpage. It can construct a list of feeds for any particular language and can add or remove feeds when so requested. Adding and removing feeds means that the subscription list has changed, and thus the SubscriptionList is notified.</li>
<li><strong>SubscriptionList:</strong> This class can construct a list of all feeds currently subscribed to. For every feed loaded in the list, it will request from the ArticleList to load all associated articles. When a feed is removed from the subscription list, this class will request from the ArticleList to remove all associated articles.</li>
<li><strong>ArticleList:</strong> When requested, this class will construct a list of articles for the particular feed passed to it. This is an additive operation, which means that multiple calls to this method will simply append more articles to the already constructed list. This is due to Zeeguu only allowing us to request articles for one feed at a time. When a feed has been removed, we simply iterate over our constructed list and remove all article-links associated to that feed.</li>
</ul><p>Construction of addable feeds, subscribed feeds, or article-links is done by use of a predefined HTML template. Each template has certain variables associated with the feed or article, which is filled-in by our classes when iteratively appending this template to the document. This allows us to keep the look and feel of the interface separate from the implementation of feed and article management.</p><h2>Translation</h2><p>Similarly to the subscription package we try to keep a close correlation between the natural structure of the article translation page and the class definitions:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Translator:</strong> allows us to translate text enclosed in our custom Zeeguu Tag (see the Back-end section on how these tags are made to be present in the document). On translation, it will request Zeeguu for translation data, and will append this data as attributes to the tag. It can also tell whether or not a tag has been translated already by checking for the presence of a \texttt{numTranslations} property, since this property is defined after translation to represent the number of alternative translations.</li>
<li><strong>AlterMenu:</strong> manages a simple window that shows a list of alternative translations to a word, which it constructs out of the translation attributes associated with the Zeeguu tag. It binds Onclick listeners to all listed alternatives, which will replace the translation when triggered. When there are no alternatives, it will request the Notifier class to notify the user about this.</li>
<li><strong>Notifier:</strong> A  very simple class that acts as a wrapper to the MDL Snackbar: a simple pop-up message at the bottom of the screen. This class makes sure that repeated messages are only shown once when the message is still visible to the user in order to decrease the amount of visual `spam&apos; the user receives.</li>
</ul><h2>ZeeguuRequests</h2><p>The Zeeguu Platform is a RESTful service, and is thus accessible using <em>POST</em> and <em>GET</em> requests on certain endpoints. The zeeguuRequests package only contains two method definitions: one to send a <em>GET</em> request to an endpoint, another to send a <em>POST</em> request. You supply the methods with the particular endpoint you wish to access and the data that should go along with it. Additionally you provide a callback method that will be used to handle the server&apos;s reply. </p><p>This design allows us to access all available endpoints on Zeeguu, without having to continuously (re-) define a custom HTTP request. Furthermore, requiring a callback method instead of simply returning the requested data makes sure that the application will not block and wait for a reply. Keeping the client-side application responsive.</p></div>

      <div class="manual-card">
        <div data-ice="card"><h1>UI Design</h1><h2>Goals</h2><p>Our team strongly believes in the <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/#introduction-principles">Material Design</a> philosophy, where hierarchy, meaning and focus are combined with tactile and intuitive design. </p><p>As the application&apos;s primary focus is to help the user <em>read</em> articles (in many different languages), we would like to minimise the number of distractions on the screen. Material design helps us achieve this goal, but we must still be careful to not clutter the screen with either features or information. At the same time, actions, settings, and information should remain quick and intuitive to access. We believe that hard to reach tools and information will end up not being used by our users.</p><p>Finally, the interface has to be as responsive as we can make it, due to the system having to be compatible with a broad range of web-enabled devices without modifying the code-base.</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>Adhering to the goals as mentioned above, we came to the design as described below. We made use of the MDL framework to implement most of these designs, along with Google&apos;s wonderfully broad set of <a href="https://material.io/icons/">Material Design icons</a>. The framework is designed to be optimally responsive, where the scale and position of elements will adapt to fit many resolutions and dimensions. Where custom styling had to be defined, we either scaled the elements to percentages of the screen or the size of the font. This should (and has been tested to) keep the custom elements properly scaled as well. See page \pageref{FrameworksAndDependencies} for more information on MDL.</p><p>When it comes to color we usually went with a light or dimmed blue for important items, unless there was a clear reason not to (see the section about article listing). This is to attract the attention of the user whilst remaining easy on the eye if they intend to ignore it. Anything else should be a neutral white: just like paper.</p></div>

      <div class="manual-card">
        <div data-ice="card"><h1>How to Build and Run</h1><h2>Sources</h2><p>All files needed to setup your own version of Zeeguu UMR can be cloned from this repository. The <strong>master</strong> branch contains the latest stable release, whilst <strong>development_core</strong> contains the in-development version.</p><h2>Setting up your development environment</h2><p>The sources include a small script called <em>dev_setup.sh</em>, which you should be able to execute on most UNIX compliant environments. It will try to install the needed packages, after which it will setup a virtual python environment consistent with <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io">virtualenv-wrapper</a> conventions. </p><p>In the case your system does not allow for this shell script to do all the work for you, or you desire a more custom configuration, you should be able to look at the script and perform the listed tasks manually.</p><h2>Local deployment</h2><p>Local deployment of the Zeeguu UMR system consists of the deployment of a Flask app, which is a relatively straightforward procedure automated in the <em>zeeguu_umr.sh</em> script. Executing this script will launch your Flask server on <em>0.0.0.0:8800</em>, but this can be easily changed to any IP-address or port you desire.</p><h2>Remote deployment</h2><p>There are many methods and services that allow you to launch Zeeguu UMR on a non-local network, but we chose for the <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku Cloud Platform</a>. It provides a basic free hosting plan that is good enough for development build publishing, and it is easily upgradable should a more publicly available release be desired. In their implementation, you can simply push your code-base to your server-associated repository, and it will be build and executed there automatically. </p><p>If you intend to deploy on this platform as well, the repository has the required <em>Procfile</em> already included. Make sure you describe <em>zeeguu_umr.py</em> as the flask executable in the required environment variable.</p></div>
